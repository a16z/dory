# Dory PCS

A high-performance, modular implementation of the Dory polynomial commitment scheme in Rust.

## Overview

Dory is a transparent polynomial commitment scheme with excellent asymptotic performance, based on the work of Jonathan Lee ([eprint 2020/1274](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1274)). This implementation provides a clean, modular architecture with strong performance characteristics and comprehensive test coverage.

**Key Features:**
- **Transparent setup**: No trusted setup ceremony required
- **Logarithmic proof size**: O(log n) group elements
- **Logarithmic verification**: O(log n) GT exps and 5 pairings
- **Modular design**: Pluggable backends for curves and cryptographic primitives
- **Performance-optimized**: Uses vectorized operations via `DoryRoutines` trait

## Architecture

### Core Modules

- **`primitives`** - Core trait abstractions
  - `arithmetic` - Field, group, and pairing curve traits
  - `poly` - Multilinear polynomial traits and operations
  - `transcript` - Fiat-Shamir transcript trait
  - `serialization` - Serialization abstractions

- **`setup`** - Transparent setup generation for prover and verifier

- **`evaluation_proof`** - Evaluation proof creation and verification

- **`reduce_and_fold`** - Inner product protocol (prover/verifier)

- **`messages`** - Protocol message structures (VMV, reduce rounds, scalar product)

- **`proof`** - Complete proof data structure

- **`error`** - Error types

### Backend Implementations

- **`backends::arkworks`** - Arkworks backend with BN254 curve (requires `arkworks` feature)
- **`backends::blake2b_transcript`** - Blake2b-based Fiat-Shamir transcript

## How It Works

Dory uses a two-tier (also known as AFGHO) homomorphic commitments:

1. **Polynomial Representation**: Coefficients are arranged as a 2^ν × 2^σ matrix
2. **Row Commitments** (Tier 1): Each row is committed using multi-scalar multiplication in G1
3. **Final Commitment** (Tier 2): Row commitments are combined via pairings with G2 generators
4. **Evaluation Proof**: Uses a VMV (Vector-Matrix-Vector) protocol with reduce-and-fold rounds

The protocol leverages the algebraic structure of bilinear pairings to achieve logarithmic proof sizes and verification times.

## Usage

```rust
use dory::{setup, prove, verify};
use dory::backends::arkworks::{BN254, TestG1Routines, TestG2Routines, ArkworksPolynomial};
use dory::backends::blake2b_transcript::Blake2bTranscript;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();

    // 1. Generate setup for polynomials up to 2^10 coefficients
    let max_log_n = 10;
    let (prover_setup, verifier_setup) = setup::<BN254, _>(&mut rng, max_log_n);

    // 2. Create a polynomial with 256 coefficients (nu=4, sigma=4)
    let coefficients: Vec<_> = (0..256).map(|_| rand::random()).collect();
    let polynomial = ArkworksPolynomial::new(coefficients);

    // 3. Define evaluation point (length = nu + sigma = 8)
    let point: Vec<_> = (0..8).map(|_| rand::random()).collect();

    let nu = 4;     // log₂(rows) = 4 → 16 rows
    let sigma = 4;  // log₂(cols) = 4 → 16 columns

    // 4. Prove: commit to polynomial and create evaluation proof
    let mut prover_transcript = Blake2bTranscript::new(b"dory-example");
    let (commitment, evaluation, proof) = prove::<_, BN254, TestG1Routines, TestG2Routines, _, _>(
        &polynomial,
        &point,
        None,  // DoryCommitment: Will compute if None
        nu,
        sigma,
        &prover_setup,
        &mut prover_transcript,
    )?;

    // 5. Verify: check that the proof is valid
    let mut verifier_transcript = Blake2bTranscript::new(b"dory-example");
    verify::<_, BN254, TestG1Routines, TestG2Routines, _>(
        commitment,
        evaluation,
        &point,
        &proof,
        nu,
        sigma,
        verifier_setup,
        &mut verifier_transcript,
    )?;

    println!("Proof verified successfully!");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance Considerations

This implementation is optimized for performance:

- **Vectorized Operations**: The `DoryRoutines` trait provides optimized methods for batch operations:
  - `fixed_base_vector_scalar_mul` - Vectorized scalar multiplication
  - `fixed_scalar_mul_bases_then_add` - Fused multiply-add with base vectors
  - `fixed_scalar_mul_vs_then_add` - Fused multiply-add for vector folding

- **Pluggable Polynomial Implementations**: The `Polynomial` and `MultilinearLagrange` traits are exposed, allowing users to provide custom polynomial representations optimized for their specific use cases (e.g., sparse polynomials)

- **Backend Flexibility**: The modular design allows backend implementations to leverage hardware acceleration and custom high performance arithmetic libraries
